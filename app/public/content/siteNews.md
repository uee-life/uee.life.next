# UEE.life is BACK!

Sadly due to a catastrophic data loss a couple of years ago, tied with life pressures of a new job and personal things, UEE.life had to be taken back offline indefinitely. This made us all very sad, and we vowed to bring the site back one day, and continue development of it.

Over the last year we have been planning and exploring options for a new, improved and enhanced version of UEE.life, and building a vision for the future. This marks the first stage of realizing that vision!

We have had to re-write the site entirely in a new major version of the framework we are using (Vue+Nuxt) due to the original version going end of life, which has led to large amounts of code changes, but also has given us some cool new features to optimize and improve quality and performance of the site. We are also moving to an entirely new graph based back-end, which unlocks some really cool capabilities that we hope to leverage in future.

In short, mind our dust, but we are excited to be back, and even more excited for the features we will be able to bring you soon!

Stay tuned. The future starts now!
