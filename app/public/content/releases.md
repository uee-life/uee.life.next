# v0.1.0 Initial Test Release
*Updated: 20 July 2954*

Given this is a full re-write of the site, in a new version of Vue and Nuxt, with an entirely new back end infrastructure, I'm starting the update numbering over again. This will allow us to track the re-release of old features, as well as new features being added.

This test release is going to be pretty large, as I have been working on the new version (internal codename uee.life.next) for a while, but susequent releases will be much more specific.
